# A World View of Climate Protection
This project takes a deep dive into some of the factors that contribute to climate change and some relief efforts in different countries. It looks into emissions, energy consumption, renewable energy usage, and the climate change protection index by generating interactive world maps that show how countries are contributing to and working to reduce climate change.

## Usage
`climate_protection.ipynb` will generate all visualizations and can be run using a Jupyter Notebook-like interpreter.

## Topics
This project looks into many different aspects of climate change and there are plans to cover much more. Currently, there are maps for the following:
- Climate Change Protection Index (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change_Performance_Index)
- Greenhouse Gas Emissions per Capita
- Methane Emissions per Capita
- Nitrous Oxide Emissions per Capita
- CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions per Capita
- Share of Global CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions
- Percent Growth of CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions
- Primary Source of CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions
